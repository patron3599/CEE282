# CEE282
Stanford University - Nonlinear Structural Analysis 

This repository contains the final programming project for the nonlinear structural analysis course. It uses object-oriented programming to 
first call the parent classes created in the CEE280 project (we are provided a correct code) to then build and store the information of your 
2D-model. It then executes the analysis using matrix structural analysis, the stiffness method, and also accounts for the nonlinearity of the 
structure by applying a geometric nonlinear matrix to each element. The use of this code is done through MASTAN2 (https://www.mastan2.com/) 
which is a MATLAB backed structural analysis program.

Adhering to the Stanford Honor Code, the code in this repository is not meant to be used for future projects or assignments.
