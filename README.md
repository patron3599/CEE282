Stanford University - Nonlinear Structural Analysis 

This repository contains the final programming project for the nonlinear structural analysis course. It uses object-oriented programming to 
build and store the information of your 2D-model and then execute it's analysis using matrix structural analysis and the stiffness method. 
The use of this code is done through MASTAN2 (https://www.mastan2.com/) which is a MATLAB backed structural analysis program.

Adhering to the Stanford Honor Code, the code in this repository is not meant to be used for future projects or assignments.
